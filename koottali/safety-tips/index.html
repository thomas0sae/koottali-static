      <h1 class="main__title">Koottali Dating App Safety Tips</h1>
      <p>
        This is a friendly reminder from us at Koottali that meeting new people
        can be exciting, but it's important to take precautions when interacting
        with strangers for the first time. Please use your best judgement and
        prioritize your personal safety. While we cannot control the behavior of
        others, we offer some helpful tips to ensure you have a safe and
        enjoyable experience on our platform.
      </p>
      <h5>Online Safety</h5>
      <p>
        Important reminder: We strongly advise against sharing any financial
        information with anyone on our app. This includes wiring or sending
        money, even if it seems urgent. Such transactions can be very difficult
        to reverse or track down. Please do not disclose any financial account
        details to anyone. If someone requests money from you, please report it
        to us immediately. For additional tips on avoiding romance scams, please
        check out the advice provided by the U.S Federal Trade Commission on
        their website. <br />
        <br />This is a friendly reminder to be mindful of your personal
        information online. Please keep your social security number, home
        address, and daily routines private when interacting with strangers. If
        you are a parent, we recommend limiting the information you provide
        about your children on your profile and in conversations with others.
        It's best to avoid mentioning specific details such as names, schools,
        ages, or genders. Thank you for taking precautionary measures to stay
        safe online. <br /><br />
        There are safety measures in place for your protection while using the
        Koottali platform. We recommend keeping all conversations on the
        platform until you feel comfortable moving the conversation elsewhere.
        If someone attempts to move the conversation to another communication
        channel too quickly, we advise being cautious as it could be a potential
        warning sign.
        <br /><br />
        Please be advised to exercise caution when pursuing long distance and
        overseas relationships. There have been cases of fraud where impostors
        claim to be from your country but are actually stranded elsewhere and
        request financial assistance. It is important to be wary of individuals
        who refuse to meet in person or engage in phone or video conversations.
        Also, be cautious of those who avoid answering your questions or
        pressure you for a serious relationship without first meeting in person.
        <br /><br />
        We take the safety and security of our users very seriously. If you see
        any suspicious or offensive behavior, please report it to us immediately
        so we can take appropriate action. We encourage you to help us maintain
        a positive and secure environment for everyone. Thank you for being a
        part of Koottali.
        <br /><br />
        It is common to receive requests for financial assistance or donations.
        <br /><br />
        Please be advised that our site is not intended for use by individuals
        under the age of 18. Thank you for your understanding in maintaining a
        safe online community.
        <br /><br />
        Harassment, threats, and offensive messages
        <br /><br />
        Inappropriate behavior exhibited during or after is unacceptable and
        must be reported. Let's work together to ensure a safe and professional
        environment.
        <br /><br />
        Deceitful profiles
        <br />
        <br />
        Please refrain from sending spam messages, buying or selling requested
        items or services, promoting commercial websites or attempting to sell
        goods or services.
        <br /><br />
        If you ever come across any suspicious activity on a profile page,
        please feel free to report it by emailing us at hello@koottali.app. For
        further information regarding how to act within our community, please
        refer to our Community Guidelines.
        <br /><br />
        This is a friendly reminder to protect your account while using shared
        or public computers. Please be wary of any email requesting your
        username and password as Koottali will never ask for this information.
        If you do receive such an email, please contact us immediately. Thank
        you for prioritizing the security of your account.
      </p>
      <h5>In-Person Meeting</h5>

      <p>
        Don't rush. It's important to take your time and get to know someone
        before making any decisions about meeting up or communicating outside of
        Koottali. While it may seem inconvenient, we recommend asking questions
        to identify any potential red flags or dealbreakers. Additionally, using
        a phone or video chat as a screening tool can be a helpful way to
        evaluate your matches.
        <br /><br />It's important to meet someone new in a public and
        well-populated place, and avoid meeting at private locations such as
        your home or your date's home. If your date insists on going to a
        secluded or secret location, it's best to leave the date immediately and
        ensure you safely return home. <br /><br />For your safety, it's
        recommended that you inform a friend or family member about your plans,
        including where you'll be going and when you plan to return.
        Additionally, make sure to keep your cell phone charged and with you at
        all times. This way, in case of any emergency, you can easily call for
        help. <br /><br />It's important to have control over your
        transportation when going on a date. This way, you can leave at any time
        during the date if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. If you're driving
        yourself, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan in case of
        unexpected circumstances. <br /><br />When you move to a new region,
        familiarize yourself with the laws that govern it and find out what, if
        any, legal protective measures are available to you. If you want to
        interact with new people in these nations, be cautious - some law
        enforcement agencies have been reported to utilize dating apps as
        instruments for potential entrapment.
      </p>
      <h5>Help, Support, and Advice</h5>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that no safety measures are foolproof. Even if you follow
        these guidelines, there is no way to ensure that everything will go
        smoothly. Remember that any negative incidents are not your fault and
        help is available. If anything happens, report it to Koottali and
        consider reaching out to one of the resources listed below. In case of
        immediate danger or emergency, please call 911 (U.S. or Canada) or your
        local law enforcement agency for assistance.
