      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Neighar operates in three simple steps. Firstly, users are required to download the free iOS or Android app and take a quick 5-question test to determine their unique 16 personality type. Secondly, the app recommends personalities that are likely to be compatible and a good match based on the test results. Users are encouraged to be themselves and simply connect with those suggested personalities. Finally, users can choose to either like or pass on recommended personalities, and enjoy the process of connecting with like-minded individuals.
