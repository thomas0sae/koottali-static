    <h1 class="main__title">Neighar Neighborhood & Community App Safety Tips</h1>
    <p>
      This is a friendly reminder from us at Neighar that meeting new people
      can be exciting, but it's important to take precautions when interacting
      with strangers for the first time. Please use your best judgement and
      prioritize your personal safety. While we cannot control the behavior of
      others, we offer some helpful tips to ensure you have a safe and
      enjoyable experience on our platform.
    </p>
    <h5>Online Safety</h5>
    <p>
      Important reminder: We strongly advise against sharing any financial
      information with anyone on our app. This includes wiring or sending
      money, even if it seems urgent. Such transactions can be very difficult
      to reverse or track down. Please do not disclose any financial account
      details to anyone. If someone requests money from you, please report it
      to us immediately. For additional tips on avoiding romance scams, please
      check out the advice provided by the U.S Federal Trade Commission on
      their website. <br />
      <br />This is a friendly reminder to be mindful of your personal
      information online. Please keep your social security number, home
      address, and daily routines private when interacting with strangers. If
      you are a parent, we recommend limiting the information you provide
      about your children on your profile and in conversations with others.
      It's best to avoid mentioning specific details such as names, schools,
      ages, or genders. Thank you for taking precautionary measures to stay
      safe online. <br /><br />
      There are safety measures in place for your protection while using the
      Neighar platform. We recommend keeping all conversations on the
      platform until you feel comfortable moving the conversation elsewhere.
      If someone attempts to move the conversation to another communication
      channel too quickly, we advise being cautious as it could be a potential
      warning sign.
      <br /><br />
      Please be advised to exercise caution when pursuing long distance and
      overseas relationships. There have been cases of fraud where impostors
      claim to be from your country but are actually stranded elsewhere and
      request financial assistance. It is important to be wary of individuals
      who refuse to meet in person or engage in phone or video conversations.
      Also, be cautious of those who avoid answering your questions or
      pressure you for a serious relationship without first meeting in person.
      <br /><br />
      We take the safety and security of our users very seriously. If you see
      any suspicious or offensive behavior, please report it to us immediately
      so we can take appropriate action. We encourage you to help us maintain
      a positive and secure environment for everyone. Thank you for being a
      part of Neighar.
      <br /><br />
      It is common to receive requests for financial assistance or donations.
      <br /><br />
      Please be advised that our site is not intended for use by individuals
      under the age of 18. Thank you for your understanding in maintaining a
      safe online community.
      <br /><br />
      Harassment, threats, and offensive messages
      <br /><br />
      Inappropriate behavior exhibited during or after is unacceptable and
      must be reported. Let's work together to ensure a safe and professional
      environment.
      <br /><br />
      Deceitful profiles
      <br />
      <br />
      Please refrain from sending spam messages, buying or selling requested
      items or services, promoting commercial websites or attempting to sell
      goods or services.
      <br /><br />
      If you ever come across any suspicious activity on a profile page,
      please feel free to report it by emailing us at hello@neighar.app. For
      further information regarding how to act within our community, please
      refer to our Community Guidelines.
      <br /><br />
      This is a friendly reminder to protect your account while using shared
      or public computers. Please be wary of any email requesting your
      username and password as Neighar will never ask for this information.
      If you do receive such an email, please contact us immediately. Thank
      you for prioritizing the security of your account.
    </p>
    <h5>In-Person Meeting</h5>

    <p>
      Don't rush. It's important to take your time and get to know someone
      before making any decisions about meeting up or communicating outside of
      Neighar. While it may seem inconvenient, we recommend asking questions
      to identify any potential red flags or dealbreakers. Additionally, using
      a phone or video chat as a screening tool can be a helpful way to
      evaluate your matches.
      <br /><br />It's important to meet someone new in a public and
      well-populated place, and avoid meeting at private locations such as
      your home or your date's home. If your date insists on going to a
      secluded or secret location, it's best to leave the date immediately and
      ensure you safely return home. <br /><br />For your safety, it's
      recommended that you inform a friend or family member about your plans,
      including where you'll be going and when you plan to return.
      Additionally, make sure to keep your cell phone charged and with you at
      all times. This way, in case of any emergency, you can easily call for
      help. <br /><br />It's important to have control over your
      transportation when going on a date. This way, you can leave at any time
      during the date if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. If you're driving
      yourself, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan in case of
      unexpected circumstances. <br /><br />When you move to a new region,
      familiarize yourself with the laws that govern it and find out what, if
      any, legal protective measures are available to you. If you want to
      interact with new people in these nations, be cautious - some law
      enforcement agencies have been reported to utilize neighborhood & community apps as
      instruments for potential entrapment.
    </p>
    <h5>Help, Support, and Advice</h5>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that no safety measures are foolproof. Even if you follow
      these guidelines, there is no way to ensure that everything will go
      smoothly. Remember that any negative incidents are not your fault and
      help is available. If anything happens, report it to Neighar and
      consider reaching out to one of the resources listed below. In case of
      immediate danger or emergency, please call 911 (U.S. or Canada) or your
      local law enforcement agency for assistance.
